# wordlist
custom password list creator  and custom username list creator (I use this with kerbrute)

this is for me, because i always lose this code and then i have to write it over and over ðŸ˜ª... btw, if anyone finds it useful feel free to use it too.

# passwd
just edit the 'words' array with your target name, you can use l33t speak too.
```
./passwd
```
